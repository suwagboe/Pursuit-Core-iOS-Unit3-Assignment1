   Your detail View Controller should contain:

    A UIImage
    A label to represent the date
    Two labels to represent the opening and closing prices
    If the stock price went up that day, set the background color to green and make the image a thumbs up.

    If the stock price went down that day, set the background color to red and make the image a thumbs down.

    You will need to use Auto Layout to constrain your views.}
